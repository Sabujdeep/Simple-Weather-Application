# Simple Silly Weather Application

A very simple and stupid weather application with a GUI
This JavaScript program can take input(a city name) from the user and show the current weather report of that city.

# Requirements

API key

This program uses a third party weather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to get the weather report. To get a new API key from https://openweathermap.org/api for free all you need to do is to sign up in the website using your email. When you complete the sign up process you will get an API key. Now open the 'weather.py' file in your favourite text editor ang go to line 6 where you will find a variable named api_key and assign the API key to that variable like api_key = "api-key-from-openweather.org".

# How to run

 You can run the program by using opening the live server.
